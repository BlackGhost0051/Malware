# Keylogger

A keylogger, short for "keystroke logger," is a type of surveillance technology used to monitor and record each keystroke typed on a keyboard. Keyloggers can be used for various purposes, ranging from legitimate monitoring (such as parental control or employee supervision) to malicious intent (such as stealing personal information, passwords, or other confidential data).
