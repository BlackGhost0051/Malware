## What is Malware?

Malware, short for malicious software, refers to any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network. Types of malware include viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, and scareware, among others. Malware can be disguised as legitimate software, can replicate itself, and can spread through networks to infect as many systems as possible.
